;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Main function is `centi-assign'.  It's very similar to <f3>, except
;; `centi-assign' prompts you for a key combination to use, while for
;; <f3> this key combination is always <f4>.
;;
;; With `centi-assign' you can have as many macros as you wish, bound to
;; whatever global keys you wish.
;;
;; Here's an example, assuming (global-set-key (kbd "<f5>") 'centi-assign)
;;     <f5><f6>foo<f6>                 ;; Now <f6> inserts "foo".
;;     <f5><f7><f6>bar<f7>             ;; Now <f7> inserts "foobar".
;;     <f5><f8><f6>-<f7>-<f6><f8>      ;; Now <f8> inserts "foo-foobar-foo".
;;     <f5><f6>omg<f6>                 ;; Now <f6> inserts "omg",
;;                                     ;;     <f7> - "omgbar",
;;                                     ;;     <f8> - "omgbar-omg-omg".
;;
;;
;; And here's the result of `centi-summary':
;;     [f8]: [f6 f7 f6] (was bookmark-bmenu-list)
;;     [f7]: [f6 98 97 114] (was winner-undo)
;;     [f6]: foo (was next-error)
;;
;; `centi-assign' will work with any global binding, i.e. you could even
;; re-bind "a" to insert "b" if you wanted.
;;
;; Calling `centi-restore-all' will restore the previous global bindings.
